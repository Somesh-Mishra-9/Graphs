# INTRODUCTION TO GRAPH

---

**Graph:-** A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges. The edges connect any two nodes in the graph, and the nodes are also known as vertices.

### Components of a Graph

**1.Vertices**(Nodes):

- The fundamental units of the graph.
- Represent entities or points in the structure.

**2.Edges** (Links):

- Connections between pairs of vertices.
- Represent relationships or paths between entities.

### Types of Graphs

1. **Directed Graph (Digraph):**

   - Each edge has a direction, going from one vertex to another.
   - Represented as an ordered pair (u, v) indicating an edge from vertex u to vertex v.

2. **Undirected Graph:**

   - Edges have no direction.
   - Represented as an unordered pair {u, v}, meaning the connection between u and v is bidirectional.

3. **Weighted Graph:**
   - Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.
   - Used to represent distances, costs, or other metrics.
